    A queue is a linear data structure that stores elements in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. This means the first element inserted would be the first element to be accessed. A queue is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) similar to a stack, but it is open at both its ends. The data is inserted into the queue through one end and deleted from it using the other end. Queues are frequently used in most programming languages.

\nA real-world example of a queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle that enters first, exits first. More real-world examples can be seen as queues at the ticket windows and bus-stops.

\nSimilar to the stack ADT, a queue ADT can also be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or pointers. A queue uses two pointers - front and rear. The front pointer accesses the data from the front end (helping in enqueueing) while the rear pointer accesses data from the rear end (helping in dequeuing).

\nThe most fundamental operations in the queue ADT include: enqueue(), dequeue(), peek(), isFull(), isEmpty(). These operations are used to carry out data manipulation and to check the status of the queue.

\nEnqueue: This operation is used to insert elements into the queue. It checks if the queue is full. If the queue is not full, it increments the rear pointer to point to the next empty space and adds the data element to the queue location, where the rear is pointing.
\nDequeue: This operation is used to remove elements from the queue. It checks if the queue is empty. If the queue is not empty, it accesses the data where the front is pointing, increments the front pointer to point to the next available data element.
\nPeek: This operation is used to retrieve the frontmost element in the queue, without deleting it. This operation is used to check the status of the queue with the help of the pointer.
\nisFull: This operation verifies whether the queue is full. If the count of queue elements equals the queue size, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
\nisEmpty: This operation verifies whether the queue is empty. If the count of queue elements equals zero, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
\nIn conclusion, a queue is a versatile data structure that provides efficient operations for inserting and removing elements following the FIFO principle. It is widely used in various fields of computer science and forms the basis for more complex data structures. user continue assistant’ Sure, let’s continue with more about the queue data structure:

\nCircular Queue: A circular queue is a type of queue in which the last element points to the first element making a circular link.
\nPriority Queue: A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority and is served according to its priority. If elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.
\nDequeue (Double Ended Queue): In a Double Ended Queue, insertion and removal of elements can be performed from either from the front or rear. Thus, it does not follow the FIFO (First In First Out) rule. There are two types of Deque:
\nInput Restricted Deque: In this deque, input is restricted at one of the ends.
\nOutput Restricted Deque: In this deque, output is restricted at one of the ends.
\nMultilevel Queue: Multilevel Queue scheduling algorithm is used to schedule a process based on their priority. The multilevel queues are independent queues, and each queue has its scheduling algorithm.
\nMultilevel Feedback Queue: The Multilevel Feedback Queue is another type of scheduling algorithm. In this scheduling algorithm, the process can move between queues. The idea is to separate processes according to the characteristics of their CPU bursts.
\nApplications of Queue: Queues are widely used as waiting lists for a single shared resource like a printer, disk, CPU. Queues are also used in asynchronous data transfer between two processes. CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling are among several places where queue data structure is used.
