### Python Syntax

Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, making it easier for beginners to grasp. It uses indentation to define blocks of code, which helps in understanding the structure of the program. For example:

```python
if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Non-positive number")
```

### Keywords

Python keywords are reserved words that have special meanings to the Python interpreter. They cannot be used as variable names. Examples include `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, etc.

### Comment

Comments in Python start with the `#` symbol. They are used to explain the code and make it more understandable. For example:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Variable

Variables in Python are used to store data. They are created when you assign a value to a name. For example:

```python
x = 10 # x is a variable that stores the integer 10
```

### Datatypes

Python has several built-in data types:

- **Strings**: Textual data, enclosed in quotes.
 ```python
 name = "John Doe"
 ```

- **Numbers**: Integers and floating-point numbers.
 ```python
 age = 30
 height = 1.75
 ```

- **Booleans**: Logical values, `True` or `False`.
 ```python
 is_active = True
 ```

- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items.
 ```python
 fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
 ```

- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections of items.
 ```python
 coordinates = (10.0, 20.5)
 ```

- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items.
 ```python
 unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}
 ```

- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
 ```python
 person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
 ```

### F-String

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting.

```python
name = "John"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

### Print Function

The `print()` function is used to output data to the standard output device (screen).

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Input Function

The `input()` function is used to read a line from input, converts it into a string, and returns that string.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### Output Function

Python does not have a built-in `output()` function. However, you can write output to a file using the `open()` function with the mode set to `'w'` for writing.

```python
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
```

### End and Sep Parameter in Python

The `end` parameter in the `print()` function specifies what string is printed at the end. The `sep` parameter specifies the separator between the output of multiple arguments.

```python
print("Hello", "World", sep="-", end="!\n")
```

### Strings

Strings in Python are sequences of characters. They can be created by enclosing characters in quotes.

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
```

### Numbers

Numbers in Python can be integers or floating-point numbers.

```python
integer_number = 10
floating_point_number = 3.14
```

### Booleans

Booleans in Python represent truth values, `True` or `False`.

```python
is_active = True
```

### Python List

Lists in Python are ordered collections of items. They are mutable, meaning you can change their content.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### Python Tuples

Tuples in Python are ordered, immutable collections of items.

```python
coordinates = (10.0, 20.5)
```

### Python Sets

Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique items. They are useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}
```

### Python Dictionary

Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are mutable and can store items of different types.

```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
```

### Python Arrays

Arrays in Python are ordered, mutable collections of items. They are similar to lists but are more efficient for numerical operations.

```python
import array as arr
numbers = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

### Type Casting

Type casting in Python is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.

```python
integer_number = int("123")
floating_point_number = float(10)
```

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators in Python are used to perform mathematical operations.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
sum = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y
remainder = x % y
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators in Python are used to compare values.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
is_equal = x == y
is_not_equal = x != y
is_greater = x > y
is_less = x < y
is_greater_or_equal = x >= y
is_less_or_equal = x <= y
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
z = 3
is_true = (x > y) and (x > z)
is_false = (x > y) or (x < z)
```

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators in Python are used to perform bitwise operations.

```python
x = 10 # binary: 1010
y = 4   # binary: 0100
bitwise_and = x & y # binary: 0000, decimal: 0
bitwise_or = x | y   # binary: 1010, decimal: 10
bitwise_xor = x ^ y # binary: 1010, decimal: 10
bitwise_not = ~x       # binary: 0101, decimal: -11
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables.

```python
x = 10
x += 5 # equivalent to x = x + 5
x -= 3 # equivalent to x = x - 3
x *= 2 # equivalent to x = x * 2
x /= 4 # equivalent to x = x / 4
x %= 3 # equivalent to x = x % 3
```

### Membership & Identity Operators

Membership operators in Python are used to test whether a value is found in a sequence (like strings, lists, or tuples).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("banana" in fruits) # True
```

Identity operators in Python are used to test whether two variables point to the same object.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
print(x is y) # False
print(x == y) # True
```

### If..else

The `if` statement in Python is used for conditional execution of code.

```python
x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Non-positive number")
```

### Nested-if Statement

Nested `if` statements in Python allow for more complex conditional logic.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        print("Both numbers are positive")
    else:
        print("x is positive, y is not")
```

### Ternary Condition in Python

Ternary conditions in Python provide a shorter syntax for simple `if-else` statements.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = "Positive" if x > 0 else "Non-positive"
print(result)
```

### Match Case Statement

The match case statement in Python, introduced in Python 3.10, provides a more readable and powerful way to perform pattern matching.

```python
def http_error(status):
    match status:
        case 400:
            return "Bad Request"
        case 401:
            return "Unauthorized"
        case 403:
            return "Forbidden"
        case 404:
            return "Not Found"
        case _:
            return "Unknown Error"

print(http_error(404))
```

### For Loop

The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### While Loop

The `while` loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements in Python (`break`, `continue`, and `pass`) allow you to alter the flow of loops.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        break # exit the loop
    print(i)
```

###

### Python List Comprehension

List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterable objects.

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)
```

### Python Dictionary Comprehension

Dictionary comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create dictionaries.

```python
squares_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(10)}
print(squares_dict)
```

### Python Function Syntax

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses `()`.

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

### Arguments and Return Values in Python Function

Functions can take arguments, which are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. Functions can also return a value using the `return` statement.

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)
```

### Python Function Global and Local Scope Variables

Variables defined inside a function are local to that function. Variables defined outside of all functions are global.

```python
x = 10 # global variable

def test():
    x = 5 # local variable
    print(x)

test()
print(x)
```

### Use of pass Statement in Function

The `pass` statement in Python is used as a placeholder for future code. It tells the interpreter that the statement is intentionally left blank.

```python
def not_implemented():
    pass
```

### Return Statement in Python Function

The `return` statement in Python is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called. It can contain an expression which gets evaluated and the value is returned.

```python
def square(number):
    return number ** 2

result = square(4)
print(result)
```

### Python range() Function

The `range()` function in Python returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (also by default), and stops before a specified number.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

### *args and **kwargs in Python Function

`*args` is used to pass a non-keyworded, variable-length argument list, and `**kwargs` is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list.

```python
def print_info(name, *args, **kwargs):
    print(name)
    print(args)
    print(kwargs)

print_info("John", 25, "New York", job="Engineer", hobby="Reading")
```

### Python Closures

A closure in Python is a function object that has access to variables from its enclosing lexical scope, even when the function is called outside that scope.

```python
def outer_function(x):
    def inner_function(y):
        return x + y
    return inner_function

closure = outer_function(10)
print(closure(5))
```

### Python ‘Self’ as Default Argument

The `self` parameter in Python is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods associated with that instance.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.my_variable = 10

    def my_method(self):
        print(self.my_variable)

obj = MyClass()
obj.my_method()
```

### Decorators in Python

Decorators in Python are a way to modify or extend the behavior of a function or class. They allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### Python Map Function

The `map()` function in Python applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as list, tuple, etc.) and returns a list of the results.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
print(list(squared))
```

### Filter Function

The `filter()` function in Python constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
print(list(even_numbers))
```

### Reduce Function

The `reduce()` function in Python applies a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along.

```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
print(product)
```

### Lambda Function

Lambda functions in Python are small anonymous functions. They are defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by a list of arguments, a colon, and an expression.

```python
multiply = lambda a, b: a * b
print(multiply(5, 3))
```

### Python Classes and Objects

Classes in Python are used to define new data types. Objects are instances of these classes.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

person = Person("Alice", 30)
person.greet()
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism in Python allows us to define methods in the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class.

```python
class Bird:
    def intro(self):
        print("There are many types of birds.")

    def flight(self):
        print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")

class Sparrow(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        print("Sparrows can fly.")

class Ostrich(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        print("Ostriches cannot fly.")

sparrow = Sparrow()
ostrich = Ostrich()

sparrow.intro()
sparrow.flight()

ostrich.intro()
ostrich.flight()
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance in Python is a way of creating a new class using details of an existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class).

```python
class Bird:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Bird is ready")

    def whoisThis(self):
        print("Bird")

    def swim(self):
        print("Swim faster")

# child class
class Penguin(Bird):
    def __init__(self):
        # call super() function
        super().__init__()
        print("Penguin is ready")

    def whoisThis(self):
        print("Penguin")

    def run(self):
        print("Run faster")

peggy = Penguin()
peggy.whoisThis()
peggy.swim()
peggy.run()
```

### Abstract

Abstract classes in Python are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method declared in an abstract class but does not contain any implementation.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractClassExample(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def do_something(self):
        pass

class AnotherSubclass(AbstractClassExample):
    def do_something(self):
        super().do_something()
        print("The subclass is doing something")

x = AnotherSubclass()
x.do_something()
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation in Python is the mechanism of hiding the data implementation by restricting access to public methods. It is a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself.

```python
class Computer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__maxprice = 900

    def sell(self):
        print("Selling Price: {}".format(self.__maxprice))

    def setMaxPrice(self, price):
        self.__maxprice = price

c = Computer()
c.sell()

# change the price
c.__maxprice = 1000
c.sell()

# using setter function
c.setMaxPrice(1000)
c.sell()
```

### Iterators

Iterators in Python are objects that can be iterated (looped) upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.

```python
class MyNumbers:
    def __iter__(self):
        self.a = 1
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        x = self.a
        self.a += 1
        return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
```

### Python File Handling

Python provides several functions to work with files. The key functions are `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`.

```python
# Writing to a file
f = open("demofile2.txt", "w")
f.write("Writing to a file is fun")
f.close()

# Reading from a file
f = open("demofile2.txt", "r")
print(f.read())
```

f = open("demofile2.txt", "w")
f.write("Writing to a file is fun")
f.close()
```

### Python Append to Files

To append to a file in Python, you can use the `open()` function with the mode set to `'a'` for appending. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

```python
import pickle

data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Serializing data
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as file:

### Python File Handling - Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming in Python allows for the execution of tasks concurrently, without blocking the execution of the rest of the program. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as network requests or file operations, where waiting for a response can significantly slow down the overall execution time. Python's asyncio module provides the infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.

Key Concepts in Asynchronous Programming
Coroutine: A special kind of function that can be paused and resumed, allowing other tasks to run in the meantime. Coroutines are defined using async def.
Event Loop: The core of every asyncio application. The event loop schedules and executes coroutines, handles I/O events, and manages the execution of callbacks.
Await: A keyword used in coroutines to wait for the result of another coroutine. It suspends the execution of the current coroutine until the awaited coroutine completes.
Task: A subclass of Future that wraps a coroutine. Tasks are scheduled on the event loop and can be awaited.
Example: Simple Asynchronous HTTP Request
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to make an asynchronous HTTP request using asyncio and the aiohttp library:

import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        html = await fetch(session, 'http://python.org')
        print(html)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
In this example, fetch is an asynchronous function that makes an HTTP GET request to a given URL and returns the response text. The main function creates an aiohttp.ClientSession, which is used to make the request. The asyncio.run(main()) call starts the event loop, runs the main coroutine, and closes the event loop.

Example: Asynchronous File Reading
Here's an example of how to read a file asynchronously using asyncio and the aiofiles library:

import aiofiles
import asyncio

async def read_file(filename):
    async with aiofiles.open(filename, mode='r') as f:
        content = await f.read()
    return content

async def main():
    content = await read_file('example.txt')
    print(content)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
In this example, read_file is an asynchronous function that opens a file for reading and reads its content. The main function calls read_file and prints the content of the file. The asyncio.run(main()) call starts the event loop, runs the main coroutine, and closes the event loop.

Asynchronous programming in Python is a powerful tool for improving the efficiency of I/O-bound tasks by allowing other tasks to run while waiting for I/O operations to complete. It's particularly useful in web development, network programming, and any scenario where you need to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the execution of your program.
